# Credit Risk Classification

## Instructions
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets 
1. Read the lending_data.cvs data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the "loan_status" column, and then create the features (x) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
Note: A value of 0 in the "loan_status" column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

## Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance by doing the following:
   - Generate a confusion matrix.
   - Print the classification report.
4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

## Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report 
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models used. Write the report as the README.md file. 

Structure your report by using the report template that the .zip file includes, ensuring that is contains the following: 
1. An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the analysis.
2. The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
3. A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
