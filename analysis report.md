# Analysis Report 

## Overview of the Analysis

We will be utilizing a dataset using machine learning models to predict the determination as to whether the loan would be categorized as healthy or high-risk. We defined the following variables as:
- 'y' = loan statuses 
- 'X' = financial variables 

## Analysis Steps
1. Load data into a pandas dataframe.
2. Define 'X' and 'y'.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets. 
4. Fit a logistic regression model. 
5. Evaluate the model's performance.  


## Results

* Machine Learning Model:
  * Precision (Healthy Loans): 1.00
  * Precision (High-Risk Loans): 0.85
  * Recall scores (Healthy Loans): 0.99
  * Recall scores (High-Risk Loans): 0.91
  * f-1 score (Healthy Loans): 1.00
  * f-1 score (High-Risk Loans): 0.88

## Summary

The machine learning model was able to showcase an impressive performance with precision and recalls.
